## Prey

###### Makes mobs prey on players through one simple effect!

![Inventory status effect](effect_inv.png)

When the **Prey** effect is active, players get sensed and attacked by mobs from farther away. The effect comes in five different levels which determine the customizable follow range distance in blocks, allowing modpack creators to customize the intensity of the challenge.

The defaults are set as follows:

**Prey I** - Follow range: 8 blocks

**Prey II** - Follow range: 16 blocks

**Prey III** - Follow range: 24 blocks

**Prey IV** - Follow range: 32 blocks

**Prey V** - Follow range: 40 blocks

Since this effect is intended to be triggered by other means, no actual potions are added and only commands are used.

Example command for 30 seconds without particles: `/effect Player prey:prey 30 0 true`

This mod was commissioned for Minecraft 1.12.2 to be used in the TREPIDATION modpack. [**Go check it out!**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/trepidation)
